        **PolyPhy** is an interactive visualization tool to analyze intergalactic gas and dark matter filaments (together known as 'Cosmic web') 
        using the `Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01256.pdf>`_ algorithm inspired by the foraging
        behavior of `Physarum polycephalum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum>`_ 'slime mold'.
